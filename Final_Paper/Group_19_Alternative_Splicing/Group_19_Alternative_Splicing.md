# Overview

Alternative splicing is a mechanism that produces multiple mRNA isoforms from the same gene. These isoforms are then translated into functionally different proteins.

Outside of constitutive splicing (normal splicing) there are five types of alternative splicing: 
1. Exon skipping
2. Intron retention
3. Alternative 3' splice site
4. Alternative 5' splice site
5. Mutually exclusive exons
